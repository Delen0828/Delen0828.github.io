I'm a first-year CS Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech, currently advised by Dr. Cindy Xiong Bearfield. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I worked with Dr. Shuai Li at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I'm mainly interested in project related to visualization systems, including animated visualization, collaborative visualization system, visualization recommendation system etc. For animated visualization, I'm exploring how different design option can affect people's perception of the embedded information. For collaborative visualization system, I study how AI assistant can help collaborators better communicate by integrating an auto-highlighting system. For visualization recommendation system, the problem is how to recommend the best visualization to users with their minimal interaction. 

I also have experience with traditional recommendation system, deep learning and reinforcement learning.
