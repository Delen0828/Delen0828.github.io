Results showed that tracing and staging are preferred by participants, and improve their performance in mean and variance tasks respectively. They also preferred display time 3 times shorter when staging is used. Also, encoding animation speed with mean and variance in congruent tasks is associated with higher accuracy."},{"name":"Hierarchical conversational preference elicitation with bandit feedback","publisher":"Conference on Information and Knowledge Management 2022 (CIKM 2022)","releaseDate":"2022-10-17","url":"https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/Papers/Hierarchical_CIKM.pdf","summary":"This research proposed a hierarchical structure for the traditional UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) method.
